# Assignment
1. Build a test plan and minimum 5 test cases based on your test plan. Describe
in the test plan how you would divide the different areas of the web page for
more efficient test management.

3. Based on your test plan, choose 3 or more areas of the page and write an
automated end-to-end test for each of these areas (3 or more tests in total). For
example: “Filtering by age range or downloading a brochure, etc.” Please do not
do 2 duplicate tests, e.g sort by price ascending; sort by price descending! For
the actual tests, please use any technology you’re familiar with (Java +
Selenium/Selenide, Cypress, etc.), and attach it to your reply.
